Hi there!

I am Evan Hu (胡文召), a software engineer focusing on editors, sync engines and AI applications.

Open to new opportunities and challenges. Email me or connect with me on X or LinkedIn.

## Features

- [Reverse Linear's Sync Engine](https://github.com/wzhudev/reverse-linear-sync-engine): a documentation on Linear's sync engine, which is (according to its CTO) correct and more complete than what Linear publishes internally.
- [redi](https://github.com/wzhudev/redi): A lightweight dependency injection framework for TypeScript. Used in [Univer](https://github.com/dream-num/univer) and ByteDance.
- [Univer](https://github.com/dream-num/univer): A web-based spreadsheet framework, similar to Google Sheets, with a focus on extensibility and performance.
