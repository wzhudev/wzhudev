Hi, I’m Wenzhao. I am a **Systems Engineer** and **Architect** specializing in high-performance computing and distributed state. 

My career began in the browser, where I architected complex **synchronization engines** and **rendering systems** for massive-scale productivity suites like Univer and Lark. I have since pivoted to **Agent & AI Infrastructure**, applying my background in user experience, latency optimization and distributed architectures at NVIDIA.
