Hi there! üëã

I am Evan Hu (ËÉ°ÊñáÂè¨), a software engineer focusing on editors, sync engines and AI applications. 

I am a seasoned software engineer and architect with a proven track record in designing and leading collaborative tools, including real-time editors and office suites. Specializing in real-time collaboration algorithms (OT, CRDTs), rendering, performance optimization, and scalable architecture. I led Univer, an open-source office suite framework, to 9k+ GitHub stars and adoption by 10+ enterprise clients. 

I contributed to collaborative spreadsheets and documents at ByteDance and Tencent before I joined Univer.

Open to new opportunities and challenges. Email me or connect with me on X or LinkedIn.

## Features

- [Reverse Linear's Sync Engine](https://github.com/wzhudev/reverse-linear-sync-engine): a detailed study on Linear's sync engine. The documentation is (according to its CTO) correct and more complete than what Linear publishes internally.
- [Univer](https://github.com/dream-num/univer): A web-based spreadsheet framework, similar to Google Sheets, with a focus on extensibility and performance.
- [redi](https://github.com/wzhudev/redi): A lightweight dependency injection framework for TypeScript. Used in [Univer](https://github.com/dream-num/univer) and ByteDance.
