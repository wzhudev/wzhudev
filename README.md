- Specializing in **sync engines**, **canvas rendering**, **performance optimization**, and **scalable architecture**.

## Experience 

- Now senior software engineer at **NVIDIA**, working on AI infrastructure.
- Led **Univer** as architect and tech lead. 
- Prior to this, I contributed to collaborative spreadsheets and documents at **ByteDance** (twice) and **Tencent**.

## Projects

- [Univer](https://github.com/dream-num/univer): A web-based office suite SDK, similar to Google Sheets, with a focus on extensibility and performance. Univer is adopted by more than 10 enterprise clients, including 2 Fortune 500 companies and several well-known companies in China.
